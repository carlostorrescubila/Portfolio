abstract: |
  Quality of life, as an essential component of sustainable development, is particularly relevant in transnational contexts characterized by deep inequalities in human development, equity, and social well-being. The objective of this paper is to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in transnational patterns of quality of life observed between 2018 and 2025, taking into account levels of human development. To this end, multivariate statistical techniques were applied: partial triadic analysis, which allows the identification of both the common structure of the data and the temporal evolution of the indicators, together with the HJ-Biplot and cluster analysis, which provide a multidimensional and interpretable visualization of country profiles. The results reveal consistent configurations of quality of life, largely aligned with levels of human development, and highlight persistent inequalities in environmental quality, economic accessibility, and objective well-being. These findings are relevant for the formulation of policies aimed at enhancing population well-being, particularly in countries facing structural constraints despite their high levels of development. The contribution of this research lies in its three-dimensional, dynamic, and reproducible approach, which makes it possible to identify regional contrasts that are not visible through traditional methods based on unidimensional indicators or cross-sectional analyses

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Using multivariate methods, this study uncovers consistent cross‑national patterns of quality of life and highlights enduring disparities linked to human development levels.
